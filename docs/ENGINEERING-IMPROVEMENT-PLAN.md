# Engineering improvement plan

## Goal and scope

Add automated quality gates, migrate application JavaScript to TypeScript, and improve maintainability without changing the portfolio's design, content claims, routes, or rendering architecture.

This is an implementation plan, not a record of completed changes. Follow [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) throughout implementation. Keep the original interactive Site separate.

## Current baseline

- npm with `package-lock.json`; React 19, React Router 7, and Vite 7.
- `npm test` runs the native Node test runner against `tests/*.test.mjs`.
- The build creates client assets and an SSR bundle, then prerenders HTML through `scripts/prerender.mjs`.
- Homepage components produce static markup and are never hydrated. Small browser modules attach interactions.
- Detail pages and `/play` hydrate React. `/lite` must remain script-free.
- No lint, format, or type-check commands are currently configured.
- Deployment checks run after pushes to `main`, not on pull requests.
- Existing tests cover comparison and puzzle models, progress storage, levels, and selected generated-site invariants.

The review baseline passed 23 tests, the production build, and `python3 tests/check-site.py`. Re-establish the baseline before implementation: other work may have changed the checkout.

## Working rules

- Inspect the current worktree and integrate existing changes; do not revert unrelated work.
- Deliver one coherent change per PR. Keep formatting-only diffs separate from semantic changes.
- Use npm and update the lockfile whenever dependencies change.
- Preserve routes, DOM IDs, data attributes, storage keys, metadata, gallery variants, and no-JavaScript behavior.
- Do not add a framework, state library, test runner replacement, or mandatory Git hooks.
- Do not introduce blanket lint suppressions, unchecked casts, or empty fallbacks to make checks pass.
- Do not use screenshot approval or snapshot updates to hide unintended UI changes.

## Phase 1: Readable source and basic quality gates

### 1A. Formatting

- Add Prettier with repository configuration and an ignore file.
- Format maintained JS/JSX, JSON, CSS, HTML, workflow YAML, and relevant documentation.
- Exclude generated output (`dist/`, `.build/`), dependencies, local tool artifacts, and third-party assets.
- Add `format` and `format:check` scripts.
- Preserve CSS rule order and specificity. Formatting is not permission to reorganize the cascade.

**Acceptance:** `format:check` passes; existing tests, build, and site checks pass. The diff contains no intentional behavior or visual changes.

### 1B. Linting

- Add ESLint flat configuration using the recommended JavaScript rules, React Hooks rules, and JSX accessibility rules.
- Define separate environments for browser modules, Node tooling/tests, and public browser scripts.
- Cover `src/`, maintained scripts/tests, Vite configuration, and `public/assets/theme.js`.
- Add TypeScript-aware rules when TypeScript files land in Phase 3.
- Add `lint` with zero permitted warnings. Use Prettier for formatting rather than competing ESLint style rules.
- Fix real findings surgically; record a narrow exception only when the architecture requires it.

**Acceptance:** all maintained JavaScript is linted without a blanket legacy exclusion. Hook and accessibility findings are resolved or individually justified.

## Phase 2: PR validation and reproducible tooling

Depends on Phase 1.

- Declare the supported Node 24 range in `package.json` and add a matching local version file.
- Keep `npm ci` as the CI installation command.
- Add `check:site` and an aggregate `check` command using the existing test runner and build pipeline.
- The aggregate runs formatting verification, lint, tests, build, and site checks; add type-checking and content validation when available.
- Run validation on pull requests and main pushes. Keep deployment restricted to trusted main pushes and explicitly approved main-branch manual runs.
- Separate validation from Pages publication so PRs never upload or deploy Pages artifacts.
- Scope Pages/OIDC write permissions to deployment; validation needs only read permissions.
- Use cancellable, per-PR validation concurrency separately from deployment concurrency.
- Document required commands and Python availability in the README.
- Configure the validation job as a required branch check where repository settings permit. Record if this requires owner action.

**Acceptance:** a PR runs validation without deployment permissions or deployment steps; a passing main build remains deployable.

## Phase 3: Incremental TypeScript migration

Depends on Phases 1 and 2. Keep every migration batch independently passing.

### Configuration

- Add TypeScript, React/React DOM type definitions, Node types, and typescript-eslint.
- Use separate browser and Node/tooling configurations with shared strict defaults.
- Use `strict` and `noEmit`; Vite continues to produce application assets.
- Enable `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` for migrated code and fix index assumptions with real guards or stronger domain types.
- Add `typecheck` using `tsc`, independently of `vite build`.
- Restrict browser and Node globals to the files that use them.
- Use a temporary, explicit JS migration boundary rather than silently excluding JavaScript forever.
- Enable type-aware lint rules on migrated files, including unhandled promises.

### 3A. Pure models and storage

- Convert `src/csv-model.js`, `src/play/model.js`, and `src/play/progress.js` to `.ts`.
- Define comparison rows, scenarios, evaluation success/error results, directions, mirrors, levels, shots, game state, and reducer actions.
- Use discriminated unions for outcomes and actions so impossible combinations are rejected.
- Keep integer-cent calculations, puzzle rules, state transitions, and storage compatibility unchanged.
- Keep `node:test`. Existing `.mjs` tests can import erasable `.ts` modules directly under supported Node 24; use explicit `.ts` paths and compatible compiler settings.
- Do not use enums or other syntax requiring runtime TypeScript transformation in native Node imports.

**Acceptance:** current model tests run against migrated source, not stale emitted JavaScript. Add focused tests only for bugs or behavior introduced by the migration.

### 3B. Content and React components

- Define project, experience, profile, image tuple, challenge tuple, and diagram variant types.
- Preserve `projects.json` as the content source; do not move project copy into components.
- Convert shared components and homepage sections, then detail/lite layouts and the puzzle component to `.tsx`.
- Type props, event handlers, refs, reducer dispatch, and custom CSS properties without `any`.
- Convert client and SSR entries together with their import references and build paths.
- Keep homepage rendering static and `/lite` script-free.

### 3C. Browser interactions

- Convert `src/home/interactions.js` and `src/home/client.js` to `.ts`.
- Narrow queried elements to their actual DOM types and validate required elements at initialization.
- Validate `dataset` values at their boundary instead of asserting arbitrary strings are domain values.
- Preserve optional enhancement behavior, motion preferences, keyboard behavior, and gallery hooks.
- Keep initialization and listener ownership explicit; avoid broad catches around interaction setup.

### 3D. Build tooling and exceptions

- Convert `vite.config.js` to `.ts` and type its development plugin.
- Update entry names in HTML, Vite, build scripts, and development SSR loading in the same batch.
- Keep `scripts/prerender.mjs` as a small Node entry initially; check it with TypeScript/JSDoc. Convert it separately only when the runtime and generated-bundle imports remain straightforward.
- Keep native `.mjs` tests unless converting them improves meaningful type coverage.
- Do not rename `public/assets/theme.js` to `.ts`: public files bypass Vite transformation. Either retain checked JavaScript or deliberately introduce a bundled entry while preserving early theme application.
- Preserve the small inline pre-paint theme bootstrap. Document these intentional JavaScript exceptions.

**Acceptance:** all application modules are typed; retained JavaScript has an explicit reason and check coverage. Tests, dev routes, SSR/prerendering, and production routes still work.

## Phase 4: Browser and accessibility regression tests

Depends on Phase 2. Can run before or alongside Phase 3; complete before structural or CSS refactoring.

- Add Playwright against production-built output, not only Vite development behavior.
- Serve real generated routes and the custom 404 without an SPA fallback that masks missing output.
- Test homepage and detail galleries, comparison scenarios/validation/reset, puzzle fire/undo/reset/progress, theme persistence, and navigation.
- Fail relevant tests on uncaught page errors and React hydration errors.
- Cover keyboard navigation, focus visibility, reduced motion, and the mobile navigation.
- Verify `/lite` contains no scripts and remains readable with JavaScript disabled.
- Verify homepage core content and links without JavaScript.
- Add focused axe checks for homepage, a project detail, lite, and play, including representative expanded states.
- Start with desktop and phone Chromium smoke tests; broaden browser coverage only for identified risks.
- Automate a small stable visual baseline and retain manual checks at the widths and themes listed in the design contract.

**Acceptance:** browser checks run in PR CI and catch interaction failures that model/static tests cannot. Keep a documented manual review list for behavior automation cannot establish.

## Phase 5: Content validation

Depends on Phase 3B.

- Validate project and level inputs before rendering. Keep validation build-time, not in every browser route.
- Use one schema/type source for content rather than independently maintained runtime and TypeScript definitions.
- Prefer a small schema dependency with type inference if handwritten validation would duplicate substantial structures.
- Check required fields, tuple lengths, diagram variants, unique slugs/anchors, valid references, and approved screenshot paths.
- Preserve optional blocks: missing evidence must not be filled with invented narrative.
- Reuse existing level parsing and solver checks instead of building a second puzzle validator.
- Add a `check:content` command and make production builds fail on invalid content.
- Keep generated-site checks for output-level links, metadata, assets, and script-free lite behavior.

**Acceptance:** malformed content fails with the project/field identified before prerendering; schema code does not increase browser payload.

## Phase 6: Targeted maintainability work

Depends on Phases 3, 4, and 5.

- Extract cohesive detail/lite components from `src/App.tsx`; keep route composition easy to scan.
- Share only genuinely common presentation or data logic. Do not force static homepage galleries and hydrated galleries into one lifecycle.
- Audit the complete CSS cascade before changing it.
- Consolidate duplicate and superseded rules into their intended existing layers in small batches.
- Preserve the final shared theme layer, exact color exceptions, responsive rules, motion preferences, and `?gallery=original`.
- Consider Stylelint after formatting and cascade cleanup. Do not enable rule sets that require broad visual rewrites.

**Acceptance:** simpler components and fewer contradictory overrides, with no intended content or visual changes. Browser, accessibility, and rendered checks pass.

## Phase 7: Measured performance and dependency upkeep

Depends on Phase 4. Independent of CSS cleanup.

- Measure production page transfers, route JavaScript, image loading, layout shifts, and LCP before setting budgets.
- Add intrinsic screenshot dimensions to reserve layout space.
- Generate responsive WebP/AVIF variants where measurements justify them; preserve uncropped screenshots and original full-size links.
- Keep below-fold screenshots lazy-loaded; decide eager loading from actual viewport/LCP evidence.
- Investigate route-level loading for the puzzle only if bundle analysis shows a useful benefit. Preserve prerendering and hydration.
- Add modest regression budgets based on the measured baseline, not arbitrary thresholds.
- Add Dependabot for npm and GitHub Actions; keep major upgrades separate from this migration.

**Acceptance:** measured improvements or explicit regression budgets, without degraded screenshot legibility, hydration, or no-JavaScript reading.

## Suggested delivery sequence

1. Formatting-only PR.
2. ESLint, runtime declaration, aggregate commands, and PR CI.
3. TypeScript configuration and pure model/storage migration.
4. Production browser and accessibility smoke tests.
5. Typed content and React component migration.
6. DOM interaction migration, Vite configuration, and checked tooling exceptions.
7. Build-time content validation.
8. Small component and CSS cleanup PRs.
9. Measured asset/bundle improvements and dependency automation.

## Completion checklist

- Fresh installation works using the declared Node version and `npm ci`.
- Formatting, lint, type-checking, model tests, content checks, build, generated-site checks, and browser tests pass through documented commands.
- PR validation blocks broken changes without granting deployment permissions.
- Main deployment still publishes the prerendered output.
- Homepage remains unhydrated; lite remains script-free; detail/play hydration has no errors.
- Existing routes, metadata, storage, gallery variants, design constraints, and privacy rules remain intact.
- Intentional JavaScript exceptions and unavailable manual checks are documented honestly.
